                  SpaceX's Falcon 9 will launch the second of the two satellite SAOCOM 1 satellites into a sun-synchronous polar orbit from SLC-40,
                  Cape Canaveral AFS. SAOCOM 1B is a synthetic aperture radar Earth observation satellite to support disaster management.

                <p>
                  The SAOCOM spacecraft are operated by CONAE, the Argentinian National Space Activities Commission, and are built by INVAP. This
                  mission is also expected to include rideshare payloads Sequoia, and GNOMES-1. This will be the first polar launch from the Space
                  Coast in 60 years. The launch azimuth will be southward and the booster will land at LZ-1.
